Ecole 42 Java Specialization Path


This is the first project in a series of 4 projects with a focus on Java and the first project created by Academy+Plus. We are the counterpart of 42 located in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and the first implementation of the 42 program outside of France. We started in 2014, and each year with a growing number of students that apply and also a growing number of students we can accomodate. Feel free to pay us a visit when you feel like traveling (Ping me if you need info about cheap flights).
In order to create great software, one doesn’t only write code, one needs to design it first. This project will introduce to you the concept of UML class diagrams and ob- ject oriented design patterns, all implemented in the Java language. Writing Java code is easy since it’s very similar to C, but the real challenge is to write good OO code in Java.
You will have to implement a minimal aircraft simulation program based on a given UML class diagram. The Unified Modeling Language is used in software engineering for visualizing the design of an application. It offers programmers a standardized way of thinking about Object Oriented software, before writing any line of code.

# Objectives

Frankfurt airport recently discovered that due to frequent weather changes they have a bottleneck on some of the landing tracks. In order to find a solution, they first need to know which scenarios create the worst bottlenecks. So they decided to use a simulator where they configure and analyze multiple scenarios and hope that this will highlight them were the real problem is.
So they reach out to their local top software shop and assign them this task. Here the chief designer starts working on the concept and after analysing all the facets of the software, he makes some design decisions which, he then passes on to you in order to create the simulator.
